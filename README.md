Rename setting_t_template.php in setting_t.php and insert API Key for Google Shortner and Token of your TelegramBot


In localhost is possible to launch
php start.php 'sethook' to set start.php as webhook
php start.php 'removehook' to remove start.php as webhook
php start.php 'getupdates' to run getupdates.php

After setup webhook is possible to use telegram managed by webhost


To use the system of Bari Trasporti Bot
- Make a Telegram Bot
- Send Location to it
- Bot will send you bus stops and time tables for each

To use the application use "start.php getupdates" for manual execution. "start.php sethook" for Telegram webhook execution.
